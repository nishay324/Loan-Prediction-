# Loan-Prediction
It is a classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not.

# Problem statement:
Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban , semi urban and rural areas. Customer-first applies for a home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for a loan. Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process(real time) based on customer details provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital status, Education, Number of dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit history and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.
